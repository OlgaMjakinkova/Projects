## ðŸš€ About Me
My name is Olga, and Iâ€™m a supply chain manager changing my 
career path to the data analyst field. 
Acquired knowledge and skills in the supply chain 
specialization helped me understand that Iâ€™m obsessed
with data. This passion brought me to the Turing college, where
Iâ€™m finished learning the data analyst program. 
Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity to start my career
in the data world.
