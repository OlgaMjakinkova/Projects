RFM analyse customer segmentation visualisation
The "RFM" in RFM analysis stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value. RFM analysis is a way to use data based on existing customer behavior to predict how a new customer is likely to act in the future.
An RFM model is built using three key factors:
1. How recently has a customer made a purchase?
2. How frequently have customers made a purchase?
3. How much money did customers spend ordering the products?

Based on these factors, customers were segmented into 11 groups for future tracking and targeting with messages that best match their relationship with your business.
